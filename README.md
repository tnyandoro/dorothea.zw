# dorothea_zw

We believe that God called the Dorothea Mission into being for the purpose of evangelism - primarily in the urban townships, but also in the rural areas and on farms. Our call is to lead men, women and children out of darkness into a deep relationship with Jesus Christ.
The Headquarters of the Dorothea Mission is in South Africa and at present we have branches in Zambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Zimbabwe.
